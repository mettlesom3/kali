>> Installing discord-

	> Download Discord for Linux
	
		- Download the tar.gz file from Discordâ€™s website.
		- Extract the downloaded file to opt directory.
		
			$ sudo tar -xvzf discord-0.0.10.tar.gz -C /opt

		- Create Discord command in bin directory.
		
			$ sudo ln -sf /opt/Discord/Discord /usr/bin/Discord
			
		- Create desktop icon and menu entry.
		
			Use the discord.desktop file located in the extracted folder in the opt directory.
			
			Pay attention to two lines here: Exec and Icon.

				The exec is for executable file and you can set it to /usr/bin/Discord . The Icon is for the image of Discord that will be displayed when you search for Discord in the menu. You can set it to the /opt/Discord/discord.png. This image is present in the extracted folder.
				 The discord.desktop file is still in the /opt/Discord directory. You need to move it to /usr/share/applications directory so that your system can access this desktop entry.
			$ sudo cp -r /opt/Discord/discord.desktop /usr/share/applications

		- You are done.
