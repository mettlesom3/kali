		lspci | grep -i vga
		lspci -s 07:00.0 -v	(Note: replace 07:00.0 with your GPU ID)
	
	>> Installation_
		
		> Once the system has rebooted from doing an OS upgrade, we will proceed to install the Drivers, and the CUDA toolkit (allowing for tool to take advantage of the GPU).

During installation of the drivers the system created new kernel modules, so a reboot is required:

		apt install -y nvidia-driver nvidia-cuda-toolkit
		
		> reboot once done_
		
			reboot -f
